## Installation

To set up the environment, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In current version, you can directly run the code using the provided assets, checkpoints, and data.

Key dependencies include:

- PyTorch (>=1.10.0) for model training/inference
- SMPL for body model parameterization
- Joblib for data loading utilities

## HAMPI Dataset

The HAMPI dataset consists of synchronized plantar pressure and inertial measurements with corresponding motion capture data. Currently, only the validation split is publicly available for research purposes.

Dataset specifications:

- Contains data from 18 subjects (aged 21-69) performing 18 types of daily activities
- Each sample includes:
  - Dual-modal smart shoes measurement with plantar pressure and dual IMUs per foot (60Hz)
  - SMPL pose parameters (60Hz)
  - Noitom motion capture refined output (60Hz)

Please see LICENSE for usage terms and citation requirements.

> We have prepared the dataset ready. We would release the dataset as soon as the paper is published.

<!-- ## Training -->

## Evaluation

To reproduce paper results:

```
python eval.py
```

Note: Reported metrics may vary slightly (Â±0.1%) due to:

- Hardware differences in floating-point computation
- Random seed initialization in probabilistic components
- Minor version differences in dependency libraries

## TODO

- [ ] HAMPI Dataset release
- [x] Evaluation scripts release
- [ ] Checkpoints and assests release
- [ ] Training scripts release
